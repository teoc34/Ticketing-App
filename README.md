# Ticketing-App
This application allows the management of tickets issued for different events
The application will have the following functionalities:

it will allow reading the characteristics of the event location (eg: maximum number of seats, number of rows , zones, number/coding of seats per row, etc.)
will allow reading the characteristics of the event (ex: date, time, name, etc.)
will allow the generation of nominal tickets according to the desired characteristics (ex: VIP, lawn, tribune, boxes, etc.) .)
the generated tickets will have a unique id that can be verified later (the id will be randomly generated so that there are no duplicate ids for the same event and no possibility for participants to guess the ticket ids)
the application will put at the user's disposal a menu where he/she will be able to enter the characteristics of the location and the event, he/she will be able to generate and later validate the issued tickets,
the application must handle any kind of input and will display error messages if input values are invalid
the application will not generate execution errors for any type of input
NO external (third party) libraries can be used for reading or validating data
the solution must be implemented using only standard C++ libraries (such as iostream, string, fstream, string.h , etc) used in courses and laboratories. STL classes are only supported when explicitly requested (phase 2 only)


Example scenarios to consider:


Issuing football tickets in a stadium with two stands (Stand 1 and Stand 2 ). Each area has a row and place. Tickets for a specific match will be generated within the limit of available seats. When a user presents the ticket their unique ID will be checked to see if it is valid.
Issuance of movie tickets in the Normal or VIP categories. Each area has a row and place. Tickets will be generated within the limit of available seats. When a user presents the ticket their unique ID will be checked to see if it is valid.
Issuance of theater tickets from the Category 1, Category 2 and Box categories. Each area has a row and place. Tickets will be generated within the limit of available seats. When a user presents the ticket their unique ID will be checked to see if it is valid.


Phase 1:
Deadline: TBD
Minimum 3 classes related to the project
Classes must contain (in total, not each) at least one dynamically allocated vector of characters, one dynamically allocated numeric vector, one constant field, one static field and one method static. Members must be related to the class.
All attributes will be defined in the private area of ​​the class
All attributes will have accessor methods; setters will contain validations
Each class will contain at least 2 generic methods (other than constructors or accessors) that will be used to perform various processing
Each class will contain at least one default constructor and one with parameters. Classes with pointer members will follow the "rule of 3".
Each class will contain overloads for << and >> operators
Each class will have at least 2 overloaded operators from the following (the same operator cannot be overloaded in 2 different classes):
indexing operator []
arithmetic operators (+,-,* or /)
++ or -- (both forms)
implicitly or explicitly cast
negation operator !
relational operators (<.>,=<,>=,==)
Classes will be implemented in their own header and/or cpp file
Main function will be located in another cpp file
This phase is considered implemented if at least 75% of requirements are implemented
Changes to the project source code are managed using a Git repository. Is mandatory that students do multiple commits after each class implementation/update. Each commit must contain a short message detailing the changes. If the phase has less than 5 commits (in different days), it will not be taken into account.

Phase 2:

Deadline: TBD
The program can receive as a parameter in the command line mode of operation: if it uses a menu in the console or processes a text file with all input data (example: if the application is called oop.exe, then can be launched in execution in the following way: oop.exe data.txt, in which case it will process the data from the file received as a parameter)
The application can process data from a text file and will display the results on the console according to the above
The application will use binary files to save tickets issued to date; when restarting the application the data will be restored
All entities needed to implement the above functionality will be added to the existing classes (or new classes related to the project can be defined)
A menu will be implemented to help the user navigate through the different functionalities
At least a new class will be created by deriving an existing class
The application will contain at least one abstract class (can be interface) containing at least one pure virtual method. The pure method will be overdefined in a derived class.
Existing classes will have at least 2 virtual methods other than pure virtual ones. Methods will be overdefined by derived classes.
At least one STL class will be used in one of the existing classes
The application must work turnkey (once started it will not require any further changes to the source code to expose all the functionality)
This phase is considered implemented if at least 75% of the requirements are implemented
Changes to the project source code are managed using a Git repository. Is mandatory that students do multiple commits after each class implementation/update. Each commit must contain a short message detailing the changes. If the phase has less than 5 commits (in different days), it will not be taken into account.

BONUS:

The tickets will be generated in the form of a PDF that can be sent by email to the participant
In this case the use of third party libraries is allowed to create the PDF file
